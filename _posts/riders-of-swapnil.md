A solotraveller, I am Swapnil Madhukar Waman. A professional writer, content editor and a software engineer by profession. Currently working as a front end developer and when time permits, I travel a lot. Besides travelling, I love gardening, coding and off course chit-chatting for hours. Though I love travelling, sometime, I also love to stay inside four walls with keeping calm. A word can describe me as a simple boy who loves adventures or perhaps explorer. My earliest memories of traveling begins from start of college when I was living as bachelor. The world is so huge and as a human, as a solotraveller, I was only able to see some part of it and I loved what I roamed, saw. I am a solotraveller boy with a boundless heart and a reckless mind, rambling about everything under the sun, waiting for inspiration and hoping to inspire others.

As a solotraveller, I sometimes travelled alone, by both desire and necessity. For more reasons and I loved it. If you have not tried it yet, you should definitely try out being solo sightseer,solotraveller. I am sure, you will find something different from you to discover yourself as a new human. If you like to ask me something, you can [Contact](http://localhost:3000) page. I promise, I will get back to you soon.

A small travel blogger. An avid dreamer, love to read, a travel addicted person and a writer as well. I dream of traveling whole world and I hope to make the most of what life offers to me. Keeps passion of travelling at least a full one month outside of my country from a year and in rest of year travel in India.
## **About The Solo Globesightseer**
Hello and welcome to The Solo Globesightseer!!! As a solotraveller, I started The Solo Globesightseer primarily just to share my travelogues and thoughts from my solo travellings from germany and Austria. After a year, I realized that I had readers and these readers started commenting on my posts and sending me emails about how my posts inspired them to travel more, or to travel solo. While most of my posts are about the destinations I visited, I want to write about solotraveller stories, inspirational, tips or thoughts on solo travellings and I will make that too.
